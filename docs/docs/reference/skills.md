# Agent skills

These skills live in `.agents/skills/` in the application repository. They guide
coding agents; they are not runtime dependencies of the application.

The `better-*` skills are integrated in the primary repository at
`/home/abdulkareem/code/mern/.agents/skills/`. They are not copied into this
documentation repository; this repo documents the application repository's
skills and links to them.

Use a skill when the task matches its scope. The repository code and `DESIGN.md`
remain the source of truth, and skills do not replace formatting, linting,
typechecking, or tests.
