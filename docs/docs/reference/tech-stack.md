# Tech stack

The starter is a pnpm workspace. This page names the tools you work with directly; the manifests and lockfile are the source of truth for versions, including transitive packages.

## Runtime and workspace

| Tool                | Role                           | Canonical file                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Node.js 24 or newer | Application runtime            | Root `package.json` `engines`        |
| pnpm 11.3.0         | Workspace and package manager  | Root `package.json` `packageManager` |
| TypeScript          | Type checking and server build | Root `package.json`                  |

## Client

| Direct dependency                | Role                                          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| React and React DOM              | UI rendering                                  |
| Vite                             | Development server and client build           |
| TanStack Router                  | File routes and typed navigation              |
| Axios                            | Browser requests to the Express API           |
| Tailwind CSS and its Vite plugin | Styling                                       |
| shadcn/ui with Base UI           | Editable components and accessible primitives |
| Lucide React                     | Interface icons                               |
| Fontsource Inter Variable        | Bundled font                                  |

Check `apps/client/package.json` and `apps/client/components.json` for the current package set and UI configuration.

## Server and data

| Direct dependency | Role                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Express 5         | API and production static server               |
| Better Auth       | Accounts and sessions                          |
| Mongoose          | Application data models and MongoDB connection |
| Zod 4             | Runtime input and configuration validation     |
| Nodemailer        | Development SMTP delivery                      |
| Resend            | Production email delivery                      |

Check `apps/server/package.json` for versions. `compose.db.yaml` and `compose.yaml` select the MongoDB image.

## Email, tests, and deployment

`packages/emails/package.json` defines React Email; `packages/mail/package.json` defines MailDev. The root and server manifests define Oxfmt, Oxlint, Vitest, Supertest, and Playwright. `Dockerfile` builds the production image; Railway builds it from GitHub. The root manifest includes the Railway CLI and IaC SDK. `compose.yaml` defines the local container path. See [Railway deployment](/deployment/production) for infrastructure and production configuration.

For the exact installed dependency graph, inspect `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the application repository. Update this page when a direct technology or its role changes, not for every lockfile refresh.
