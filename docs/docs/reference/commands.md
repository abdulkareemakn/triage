# Commands

## Per-package scripts

Package-level commands are useful when working on one workspace:

```sh
pnpm --filter @mern/client generate-routes
```

## Test databases

Integration tests create and delete a random `mern_test_*` database. E2E tests use a
random `mern_e2e_*` database. Both need permission to create and drop temporary
databases and never use the application database.
