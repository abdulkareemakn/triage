description: A tour of the pnpm workspace, from the apps and packages to the root configuration files.

# Project structure

This starter kit is organized as a monorepo, with separate pnpm workspaces for the client, server, and shared packages. This simplifies development by reducing context switching, eliminating redundant configuration, and keeping shared types in sync across the codebase. It also enables the Express API and React frontend to be served from a single deployment.

```

The `client` and `server` packages are the runnable application. `shared` contains
types only, `emails` contains email templates, and `mail` runs the local development inbox. Tests live at the repository root.

## Source path aliases

The client and server map `@/*` to their own `src/` directories. Use `@/` for
all app-local imports, including shadcn UI components:

```ts
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";
```

TypeScript uses the `paths` mappings. Vite resolves the client mapping, and
`apps/server/alias-runtime.js` resolves server imports to `src/` in development
and `dist/` in production. Deno's deploy import map points the same alias at the
compiled server files.

## Root configuration files

Most root-level configuration is for development and deployment:

- `.env.example` lists the environment variables used by the server and Compose.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines `apps/*` and `packages/*` as workspace packages.
- `package.json` contains the commands for development, builds, checks, tests,
  and Docker Compose.
- `.oxfmtrc.json` and `.oxlintrc.json` configure formatting and linting.
- `compose.db.yaml` starts MongoDB for local development; `compose.yaml` starts
  the production-style app and MongoDB stack.
- `Dockerfile` builds the client and server into the production image.

## Where to add code

Put new code in the package that owns it:

- Add API endpoints in `apps/server/src/app.ts` and server integrations under
  `apps/server/src/lib/`.
- Add authentication changes in `apps/server/src/auth.ts`; keep environment
  validation in `apps/server/src/config.ts`.
- Add request validation schemas under `apps/server/src/schemas/`.
- Add reusable Express guards under `apps/server/src/middleware/`.
- Add application models under `apps/server/src/models/`.
- Add routed browser pages under `apps/client/src/routes/`, and reusable UI components to `apps/client/src/components/ui/`.
- Add browser/server response contracts to `packages/shared/src/index.ts`. Keep database and server-only code out of this package.
- Add React Email templates to `packages/emails/`.
- Add tests under `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, or `tests/e2e/` for the
  matching test level.

## Next step

Continue to [Design and UI](/build/design-system) before adding screens.
